                    <p><strong>Bioluminescence:</strong> Some marine organisms, like jellyfish and certain fish, produce
                        light through
                        chemical reactions in their bodies. This helps them attract prey, ward off predators, or find
                        mates.</p>
                    <p><strong>Symbiosis:</strong> Relationships like that between clownfish and sea anemones, where
                        both species
                        benefit—clownfish get protection, and anemones get cleaned and fed.</p>
